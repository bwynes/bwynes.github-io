            <p> I want to become a web developer because it is challenging
              and I want to be able to say I can do it.</p>

          <div class="post-content">
            <p> I've <em>always</em> wanted to learn how to creat webpages and apps.
              It has always been <stong>intemidating</stong> to me since I did not know
              much about it.</p>
            <p> I searched for many classes to take that would suit my busy
              lifestyle, then I found Mimo. It has given me confidence and
              the tools to create my very own blog!</p>
